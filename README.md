## Description
Jork is an interactive fiction game based on Infocom's 1980 hit-game Zork. The game is planned to have multiple routes that the player can take, known as non-linear progression. Most features will be similar to Zork such as the usage of commands - `attack`, `open`, `inventory`, `buy`, etc.

The objective is to make it to the last stage/chapter of the game without dying and with all required items. Dying or winning the game will lead to an ending screen that totals your score depending on their choices and how many treasures they found during the course of the game.

## How to Play
The player will be able to see their location and the objects that surround them. They will have to interact with objects to solve puzzles.

In order to progress through the game, the player types in commands. For example, entering `go west` will make the player advance west, while entering `look around` or similar, will give the player information about their surroundings.

## Cool Features
* Swords and magic
* Money and wealth
* The ability to level up
* Navigation through the bustling town of Lagoveth 

## Known Bugs
* ~~There is a minor bug that the grammar is incorrect if the first item is plural. Really minor.~~ Fixed!
* Some commands are case-sensitive (e.g. `move South` should be `move south` or it won't work)
* If you enter a known verb but an unknown noun, it does not give the player an error.

## Changelog
* 70% done with items.
* Completed map.
